Classification of Breast Cancer Tumors based on Physical Attributes
This repository hosts the project dedicated to classifying breast cancer tumors based on their physical attributes using machine learning. The aim is to refine diagnostic tools and aid healthcare professionals by predicting the malignancy of breast cancer using various physical characteristics of tumors.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women globally, constituting 30% of new cancer cases in U.S. women annually. This project investigates whether physical attributes of tumors can be predictive of their classification as benign or malignant.

Project Aim
To determine the correlation between various physical attributes and the classification of tumors, thereby investigating the predictability of breast cancer malignancy.

Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis: The physical attributes examined have no influence on the classification of a tumor as benign or malignant.
Alternate Hypothesis: The physical attributes examined are directly associated with the classification of a tumor as benign or malignant.
Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset.

Methodology
Data Collection: Data was imported into a Jupyter notebook to initiate the project.
Data Cleaning: Removal of non-contributory columns, handling duplicates and null values, and outlier detection.
Data Analysis: Employing descriptive and inferential statistics to understand and process the data.
Data Visualization: Visual representation of data to analyze features and diagnosis distribution.
Machine Learning: Utilization of various classifiers to predict outcomes based on the data.
Machine Learning Models Used
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Results
The Logistic Regression model showed the highest accuracy and was identified as the best fit model for our dataset.
